## UC Davis F1 tenth Autonomous Race Car
F1Tenth is an autonomous racing league where universities design self-driving cars to compete for the fastest car. For our ECS Capstone project, we collaborated with Prof. Nazari's CORE Lab to develop the perception and control for the labâ€™s race car, enabling it to autonomously navigate a race track while avoiding obstacles, in preparation for future F1Tenth competitions.

### Perception and Controls
* Mapping (SLAM)
We use SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to map the track before the race. The map is used for localization and planning during the race.
* Raceline Optimization
With the map from SLAM, we generate a time optimal path around the race track using CV.
* Particle Filter
During the race, we use LiDAR scans and vehicle odometry to localize the car on the map.
* Pure Pursuit
The car is driven by a global path-tracking controller that follows the path generated by raceline optimization.
* Gap Following
When an obstacle is detected, the car switches to a local obstacle avoidance controller that steers it towards the largest open gap detected by the LiDAR.

## AI Connect 4 
Design an AI algorithm to efficiently and competitively play the game of connect-4.
Developed an AI agent for Connect 4 using the minimax algorithm (based on Q-Learning) and alpha-beta pruning to optimize game strategy and performance.
Designed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform for playing Connect 4.
